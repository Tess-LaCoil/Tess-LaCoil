## Professionally Suspicious About Numbers

Hello! I'm Tess, an applied mathematician and statistician. I'm interested in the use (and mis-use) of mathematical objects as models for real world systems. The systems can be anything from sociology to ecology to quantum mechanics. 

### Projects
I have developed a statistical methodology -- the hierarchical Bayesian longitudinal model -- which uses Bayesian methods to fit differential equations to longitudinal data. The method is implemented in [hmde](https://github.com/traitecoevo/hmde) for three different differential equations, and [Here Be Dragons](https://github.com/Tess-LaCoil/hmde-be-dragons) is an in-progress investigation of a statistical issue that arises when the longitudinal model interacts with numerical integration errors.
